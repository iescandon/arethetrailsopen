## Description

![Alt Text](./client/src/assets/trails.gif)`

Various mountain bike trail facebook groups are littered with users asking for the trail status. Although some people know the answers, they get frustrated by having to constantly answer the same question over and over. There are apps that have that information available, but they are flooded with too much information that makes finding the trail status quite difficult and hard to understand. Additionally it only provides you with one trails status, so you have to go through the long process again to find out the status of another trail nearby.

This application is a single paged full-stack application designed to find out whether popular biking trails in Texas are open. The user can search by their address, city/state, or zip code to find trails near them. If user allows location access, the map will automatically render in their current location. An interactive map shows the trails listed on the map with markers and also visually states whether or not the trail is open or not based on the color. When a marker is clicked, the name and address of the trail system will be displayed in an info window. User will also be given the opportunity to view the individual trails within the trail system by clicking a button inside the info window. If they click the button, a table will be rendered with all of the trail system data including individual trail data. The table allows for users to update trail status (open/closed) as well as the individual trail conditions. Because of the nature of the targeted users, this app is designed to be very mobile responsive and fully functional on even the smallest screens.
